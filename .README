Crawl the web starting from a seed page.

Ensure the crawler doesn't crawl the same page twice.

Index every page by splitting the words within the page and then checking the index if the entry 
already exists for each word. If it doesn't add it along with the url if it does, just add the url.

Lookup functionality works as follows: Search the index using a keyword parameter as the point of 
search  and return any urls which match.
